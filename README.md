# NYC Taxi Driver Income Optimization (Without Increasing Fares)

## Overview
This project analyzes NYC Yellow Taxi trip data to understand how **driver income can be increased without increasing fares**.  
The focus is on improving **time efficiency and pickup zone selection**, rather than charging passengers more.

---

## Business Problem
Many drivers assume that working in the busiest areas leads to higher earnings.  
In reality, traffic congestion, short trips, and inefficient zones often reduce **earnings per hour**, even when demand is high.

---

## Approach
- Used **Python (Pandas)** for schema inspection and table structure validation  
- Built a structured **SQL Server pipeline** (raw → clean → analytics)  
- Cleaned and validated 38M+ trip records, retaining ~34M valid trips  
- Calculated demand, earnings per hour, trip duration, and income volatility  
- Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for decision-focused analysis  

---

## Key Insights
- High-demand city zones are not always profitable due to congestion  
- Airport pickups provide higher and more stable earnings per hour  
- Late-night and early-morning hours are the most income-efficient  
- Residential zones offer steady, low-risk income  

---

## Final Takeaway
**Driver income can be increased by improving time efficiency and zone selection, not by increasing fares.**
